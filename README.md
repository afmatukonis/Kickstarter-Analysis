Module 1: Kickstarter Project

Overview of Project

The overview of this project is to build upon the skills learned in module 1 and begin to use them in a practical way. Module 1 taught how to import data into a table for analysis, apply filters, conditional formatting, and use different formulas, generate pivot tables, create charts, and interpret them, calculate measures of central tendencies, standard deviation, and variance, identify outliers in data sets, perform Excel analysis with visualizations and interpret them. The Kickstarter Project allowed us to use the different skills we learned in the module and apply them to a real-world data set. The dataset was a culmination of different campaigns and their outcomes. 
	The purpose of the Kickstarter Project was to use our new skills to generate insights to help hypothetical Louise’s project. The main sheet had columns A-N and rows 1-4,115 which we then were able to filter and create different sheets with specific insights for Louise’s project. The main objective of this project was to provide Louise with insights on the outcomes of plays with different monetary goals in certain countries. 
	
Analysis and Challenges
	
To analyze the data first we needed to create new columns to find the percentage funded, the average donation amount, the parent category and subcategory, and the year the project was created. The first analysis that was performed was separating the category and subcategory into two different columns. This was done by converting text to columns wizard. This allowed a parent category to be formed, i.e. Film & Video and a subcategory, i.e. television or shorts. From this we created a pivot table that allowed us to view the number of campaigns sorted by parent category and then subcategory. Second we wanted to look at the length of the fundraising campaigns to see if that was correlated with success, but to do that we needed to convert the Unix timestamps to a date created conversion and then extract just the year from that column using the YEAR() function. The code for this was; =(((J2/60)/60)/24)+DATE(1970,1,1) and then =YEAR(S2). This allows for a pivot table to be created that compares the theater outcomes by launch date and can be filtered by year and parent category. From this pivot table we then can create a line graph that shows the theater outcomes based on months. In the second part of the project we had to use the COUNTIFS () function to extract data from the Kickstarter sheet and place it in a new sheet for outcomes based on goals. My code for this =COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!$D:$D, "<1000",Kickstarter!$F:$F, "successful",Kickstarter!$R:$R, "plays"). I changed the criteria “successful” to “failed” and “canceled” for the other columns. In this sheet we created a dollar-amount ranges in the goal column so projects would be grouped together based on their specific goal amount. From this we extracted the number of successful, failed, and canceled plays in each of the ranges. We also calculated the total number of projects using sum (B2:D2) and the respective percentages of successful, failed, and canceled plays. The code for that was = =(B2/E2). I then formatted the cells for percentage and. The main challenge of this was using the countifs function and having it select data on a different sheet and defining the right criteria for the ranges. From the data we pulled in and analyzed we then created a line chart that compared the percentages successful, failed, and canceled based on the dollar-amount ranges we grouped the projects into.  
	The first line chart was Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date. This visualized the relationship between each theater outcome (successful, failed, or canceled), how many there were, and each month. Based on the chart the most successful month for theater campaigns was May with 111 and then June with 100. Failures were more consistent ranging from 33 to 52, with a small drop from 47 in August to 34 in September, and then a subsequent rise in October back up to 50. Failures stayed between 1 and 7, with the month of October having zero. 
	The second line chart was Outcomes Based on Goals. This showed the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled “Plays” based on their dollar-amount range goals. From the chart we see that the highest percentage of successful plays had dollar-amount goals of less than $1000 and between $1000 and $4999. The percentage of success drops as the goal rises, with the highest percentage of failures in the $25000 to $29000 range. However, there is a rise in the percentage of successes between $45000 and $49000, but then drops again at $50000. The graph shows an inverse correlation between successes and failures. By filtering the data in the Kickstarter sheet to show only plays in the subcategory, and goals between $1000 and $4999, we know that this range had the most percentage of successes, and by looking at the data further we can see that the successful campaigns pledged over 100% of their goal and that their average donations was higher than that of the failures. 
	Two challenges that were faced were converting the Unix code into dates and then extracting the year from that and using the countifs function. For the countifs function I had to lock the columns that the function was pulling from in the Kickstarter sheet so that when the formula was dragged down the columns would not change.  

Results

From this we can conclude that the smaller the monetary goal the more likely the play will be a success, and that theater endeavors produced in May and June will have the highest number of successes, and that success will taper off in the fall with failures rising. Canceled plays stayed low throughout the year with October being the only month that had none canceled. When looking at outcomes based on goals, we can conclude that there should be a high number of successful plays when the monetary goal amount is under $5000. Limitations of this dataset are that we only have data from 2014 to 2017. More years of data could possibly change the outcomes based on launch date and possibly the outcomes based on goals. We also only broke down the outcomes based on goals by $4999 increments, but yet we started at $1000. We could create a new graph combining the goals under $1000 into the next range and that would still show that under $5000 has the highest number of successful plays. Other tables could show the comparison between successful plays and tv shows to see if one is more successful than the other, or if one is more successful in certain countries.
